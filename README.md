# smoothFlooringDigest
An automated email system that sends information about the benefits of smooth flooring to a list of email addresses. Can be modified to send email reminders for anything.

"Why?"

Owners and roommates of my home will not allow me to replace the carpet flooring in my residence with smooth flooring.
Decided to spend a day writing this python script that I can run from my android phone.

"What does it do?"

Sends emails once a day at 7:00 AM with a random fun fact about the dangers of carpet flooring.
Signoffs are also randomly chosen.

"How will this help me?"

Can be used as a template for sending emails repeatedly to a list of people.

"How do I use it?"

Download both files in the repo, then modify smoothFlooringDigestGeneric.py to your liking.
